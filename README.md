# AndroidAI
Android AI project

This project will result in an android application to carry a simple text conversion with the application user. The application will be built using native android technology and the java programming language. The application will be given English phrases commonly used in small talk and will be able to respond to these phrases as a human would. There will be a GUI that looks like a texting application, allowing the user to "text" the AI application, and then allowing the AI application to respond through text. There are several open source libraries available that help with Natural Language processing. Examples of these libraries are:

http://opennlp.apache.org/

http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html

These open source libraries provide tools to deconstruct phrases given by the user to determine the meaning of the phrase. This will then allow the application to respond appropriately to the user. The Watson Application Programmer Interface (API) has additional tools for personality insights and tone analyzer. This may allow the app to detect if the user is having a bad day and attempt to cheer them up, or help them relax if it is detecting stress. If needed and time permits, we will also implement a learning database as part of our application. This will allow our application to learn and remember past interactions with the user. This may include things like the user's name, favorite color, pet's names, etc. This will allow the application to ask questions about things learned in previous interactions. The application will attempt to pass the Turing Test, with the user of the application convinced they are interacting with an application that is listening, speaking and learning just like another human.
